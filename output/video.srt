His actions are
totally unpredictable.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
He just lives for fun,
enjoying each day.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You know what, Jae-mi?
You can never become a mom.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I want to be a mom

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
who showers
her children with love.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
who showers
her children with love.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's my dream.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Whenever I'm with my mother,
I feel like a scared little dog.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's how I came to realize

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
that I need to be
as strong as a tiger,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
to protect
the person I love.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why are you...

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
100, .

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it okay for them to find out
you're not pregnant?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I need to find someone.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It might take me
all over the country.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
-You're out of your mind.
-Wanna join me?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm never going to give up
on this marriage.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
-What are you doing?
-Kidnapping you.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait!

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You said you'd chase me,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
to the ends of the earth
if I ran away.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to the ends of the earth
if I ran away.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Can I hold you to that?

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Jae-mi!

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why are we going to Busan?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're looking for the sperm
that created this guy!

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sperm donor.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sorry.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Get him!

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you lose your way
while wandering aimlessly,

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it doesn't set you adrift.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It just makes you a drifter-

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A DRIFTING SOUL, A STOLEN BRIDE,
AND ONE LAST RIDE

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Wanna drift together?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Do you know what they call
people who talk like you?

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A fraud or a freak.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
